## Overview

**Prevue** is an app to discover, rate and review local businesses. Each user has the ability to read reviews of businesses and delete them as necessary. Admin users have the ability to add their business as well as delete them. Only registered users will have the ability to rate and view businesses.

<br>

## MVP

MY MVP is to have a working prototype of this app to include:
Single user Oauth (Sign Up/Sign In/Logout)
The ability for users to search for business by industry
The ability for authorized users to add and delete their buisiness
The ability for authorized users to rate and review buisiness as well as delete reviews
Database including  3 tables (users, companies, industries)

<br>

### Goals

- _Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet,_
- _consectetur adipiscing elit._
- _Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum._
- _Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex._
- _etc._

<br>

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|   React Router   | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
| React SemanticUI | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|     Express      | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
|  Express Router  | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
        |_containers
          |__ Main.jsx
       |_Layouts
          |_Layouts.jsx
        |_screens
           |_Login.jsx
           |_Register.jsx
         |_services
           |_ api-assist.jsx
           |_ auth.jsx
           |_companies.jsx
           |_comments.jsx


```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Create backend.     |    H     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create frontend.    |    H     |     4 hrs      
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Create components   |    H     |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Create Modules      |    H     |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Styling/Css.        |    L     |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Debugging           |    L     |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Deployment          |    H     |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     40 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
